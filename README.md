# WebDBInterface

This Python script uses the Flask web framework to create a simple web application and the `mysql.connector` module to interact with a MySQL database. It also uses the `boto3` library to interact with AWS services. The script is used to interact with a database of usernames and serial numbers and return a full name when a get request is made with the serial number.
